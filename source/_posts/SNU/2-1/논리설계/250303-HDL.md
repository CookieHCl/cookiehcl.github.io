# Behavior of combinational networks

Values(signals) are carried on wires over time!  
These values are usually visualized in waveforms.

- gate delay: time for change at input to cause change at output
  - min delay/nominal delay/max delay
- rise time: time for output to transition from low to high voltage
- fall time: time for output to transition from high to low voltage
- pulse width: time that output stays high or stays low between changes

# Hardware description language

HDL describes hardware at varying levels of abstraction. They can emulate the behavior of the designed system!

- Structural description: explicit structure of the circuit (wire, gates, etc.)
- Behavioral description: describes input/output behavior of a circuit (delays are also described!)

# Difference between programming language

## Program structure

- Circuit are described as hierarchy of modules
- Specifies interconnections between modules via schematic
- Instantiates multiple components of the same type

## Assignment

- continuous assignment (logic always computes and have value)
- propagation delay (computation takes time)
- timing is important (when does computation have its effect?)

## Data structures

- size should be always explicitly spelled out
- no dynamic structures/pointers

## Parallelism

- hardware is naturally parallel (multiple threads should be supported)
- assignments can occur in parallel
