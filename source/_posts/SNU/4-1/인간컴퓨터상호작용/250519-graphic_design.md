# Graphic Design

Graphic Design is a fundamental aspect of interface design. It helps users to:

- Follow the expected sequence of interactions
- Understand the organization of data, functions, and tasks
- Build a consistent mental model for efficient use
- Benefit from visual consistency to become more proficient over time
- Brand recognition: Graphic design can provide a distinctive look and feel

## Components of the Visual language

- Layout: How the content is structured on the display
- Typography: Typefaces & typesetting
- Imagery: Visual identity, icons
- Sequencing: How interactions unfold

## Good Graphic Design

Good graphic design uses clear, repeated visual elements to guide the viewer.  
It relies on modular structures. e.g. Same text column widths and placements.

- Create a unified visual identity
- Work across various presentation formats
- Help users navigate and understand information quickly

# Gestält Principles

The whole is different from the sum of its parts!  
Smaller objects are grouped to form larger ones.

Law of Prägnanz (Law of simplicity, Law of good figure): We tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetric, and simple. Complex images is perceived in the simplest possibility.

![Emergence](emergence.png)

Emergence: The whole is emerged as a sum of its parts. We can perceive the whole even if we have noise or insufficient information.

![Reification](reification.png)

Reification: The experienced perception contains more information than the sensory stimulus. i.e. We fill the missing part.

![Multistability Perception](multistability_perception.png)

Multistability Perception: The experienced perception can be different even if the sensory stimulus is same.

![Invariance](invariance.png)

Invariance: Perception are same even when the properties of an object change, such as its size, orientation, distance, or lighting.

![Grouping](grouping.png)

Grouping:

- Proximity: Tendency of elements to be associated with nearby elements
- Similarity: Tendency of elements to be associated with similar elements
- Continuity: Preference for continuous, unbroken contours with the simplest possible physical explanation

![Perception of Forms](perception_of_forms.png)

Perception of Forms:

- Closure: Complete, closed figures
- Figure-Ground: Smaller one as figure, larger one as ground
- Symmetry: Symmetrical components will tend to group together

# Principles of Graphic Design

CRAP: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity

## Contrast

- Guides the user's attention to the key elements of a design
- Maintain the distinction between similar elements in a design
- Helps preattentive processing

## Repetition

- Improves unity and harmony
- Creates visual consistency in page designs

e.g. Use same style of headlines, same style of initial capitals, or repeat same basic layout from one page to another

## Alignment

- The act of keeping design objects in line
- Creates a visual relationships between elements such as images, shapes, or blocks of texts
- Enhance boundaries and grouping

### Effective Visual Channel

![Effective Visual Channel](effective_visual_channel.png)

Magnitude channels are used for ordered attributes. They determine how much the amount is.  
Identity channels are used for categorical attributes. They determine what/where the value is.

### False alignment

- Almost but not quite aligned
- Free standing objects not to be aligned with other objects
- Optical adjustment
  - Center point looks different depending on the shape of the elements (e.g. sharp, round-ended, rectangular)
  - From largest to smallest, straight edges, curved edges, and sharp edges appear larger.
  - It look misaligned even if it's actually perfectly aligned!

### Relating Structure

- Grouping: Spatial logic is more powerful; Avoid explicit grouping
- Hierarchy: Privde a hierarchical context for each piece of information
- Relationship: Visual scanning order should match the logical information
- Balance: Harmonious global arrangement, usually using symmetrical objects

## Proximity

Design elements near each other are perceived as related, while elements spaced apart are perceived as belonging to separate groups.

### Negative space

Empty space can be meaningful!

- Provide the ground on which the design appears
- Enhance/Enforce the structure of the display
- Reduce the use of explicit borders
- Use negative space as a design

## Consistency

- Internal Level: inside an application
- External level: platform and interface guideline conventions

Consistency can help users from reliable expectations and avoid costly mistakes.

## Color

- Cross-Cultural color naming
  - Primary color terms are consistent across cultures (e.g. white, black, red)
- Color Categories
  - Only 8 hues are named out of 210 colors!
  - We only need small number of labels (or colors)
- Color coding
  - Low saturation is enough for large areas
  - High saturation is needed for small areas
  - We can use borders to create high saturation
- Color Deficiency
  - There are lots of color-deficiency simulators
  - Distinguish by more than hue alone, e.g. saturation, brightness
