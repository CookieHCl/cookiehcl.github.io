# Moore's law

컴퓨터의 능력은 2배씩 증가하고 있음  
하지만 사람의 능력은 거의 제자리...

현재 AI는 Human-performance를 거의 따라잡았다

# HCI

Human-Computer Interaction is a discipline concerned with the **analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation** of *interactive computing systems for human use* and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

The field of HCI is very diverse!  
e.g. focus on children, seniors, animals???

## Growing importance of HCI

- Users
  - For heterogeneous & diverse users
  - For novice users with less technical expertise (Use as tools, not for goals)
  - For almost every task in everyday life
- Technology
  - Mobile (e.g. smartphone, tabs, notes)
  - Ubiquitous (Need faster, reliable, smaller, cheaper technology)
  - Ambient (Much bigger and more complicated technology)

## User Experience (UX)

User Experience is a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service.

How does people **feel** about it?

We cannot design a user experience, we can only design **for** a ser experience.  
UX is shaped by the user and the context in which they interact with a product, which can't fully controlled by designers.

Goal of HCI is optimal User Experience!

### Characteristics of UX

a.k.a. why UX design is hard...

- Humane BUT Soft: UX should be considerate of **human needs and behaviors** but can sometimes be perceived as **lacking in hard, measurable outcomes**.
- Strategic BUT Abstract: UX design is often based on **high-level strategic thinking** to guide product development, but these strategies can be **abstract and may not always translate** directly into tangible design decisions.
- Contextual BUT Uncertain: UX design should be contextual, taking into account the **specific situations and environments** in which a product will be used. However, because contexts can change and are often complex, this can lead to **uncertainty in the design process**.

### Designing UX

We need proper theories and methodologies!  
Theories and models explains "WHY?"  
Methodologies explains "HOW?"

HCI is a field that provides theories and methodologies for optimal UX!

## Key factors of optimal UX

### Usefulness

Usefulness helps users achieve their goals effectively.  
Related to functions!

### Usability

Usability is the extent to which a product can be used by *specified* users to achieve *specified* goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a *specified* context of use.

We need *specified* users, goals, context!  
You can't just design for all humans.

#### Usability Criteria

- speed of performance (efficiency)
- rate of human error (effectiveness)
- time to learn (learnability)
- human retention over time (memorability)
- subjective satisfaction

We can use these criteria to test and measure usability!

### Affection

Affection is about emotional deisgn; How can we *persuade* people?

Design of objects are perceived on three levels:

- Visceral: First Impressions & Instincts
- Behavioral: Usability & Functionality
- Reflective levels: Meaning & Personal Connection

#### Measuring affection???

Measuring affection is really hard...

Some attempts:

- Biometric measurement: Heart rate, blood flow, etc.
- Brain measurement: Electroencephalogram, fMRI, etc.

But biometric measurement have too much noise...  
Most research interview participants.
