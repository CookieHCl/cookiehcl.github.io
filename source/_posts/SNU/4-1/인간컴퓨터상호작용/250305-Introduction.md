# Principle of Design

1. Identify needs  
  Interview people, etc.
1. Create/imagine possible solutions  
  Brainstorming and prototyping
1. Select and implement solution
1. Evaluate the result  
  We call this **HCI experiments**

We need to understand human information processing (HIP) and cognitive limitations.

# What is HCI?

Traditional CS courses is about technology, effiency, effectiveness, speed, and accuracy.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a dicipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use.  
HCI has higher level goal - optimal user experience (UX).

- Usefulness (유용성 - 도움이 되는가)
- Usability (사용성 - 쓰기 쉬운가)
- Affection (감성 - 의외로 되게 중요한 영역)

How do we measure it?

- speed of performance
- rate of errors by users
- retention over time
- time to learn
- subjective satisfaction (We can *measure* this with likert scale!)

# HCI Research Framework

1. Observation
1. Create new theories/models
1. Iterative Design Process (Repeat this!)
    1. Acceptance
    1. Analysis
    1. **Design**/Definition
    1. Ideation
    1. Idea Selection
    1. **Prototyping**/Implementation
    1. **Evaluation**
1. Use new theories/models
    - Can used as a guide for practitioners
    - Can used as an advice for evaluators
