# What is Computer Graphics?

Computer graphics is the use of computers to synthesize and manipulate sensory(usually visual) information from digital information.

Sound, touch, taste, smell is also part of computer graphics!  
3D printing even allow us to turn digital information into physical matter.

We can easily **watch** state-of-art technologies from the [SIGGRAPH Technical Paper Trailer](https://youtu.be/tjYVcOJONdI?si=UiRYX1UGAmY6GwNl).

- Entertainment (movies, games)
- Art and design
- Industrial design
- Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) (What happens when two car collide?)
- Architecture
- Scientific/Mathematical Visualization
- Medical visualization and simulation
- Navigation
- Communication (zoom, Codec Avatars etc.)

Extremely broad!!!!!  
Everything is mixed - physics(optics), mathematics(mathematical optimization), HCI, etc.
