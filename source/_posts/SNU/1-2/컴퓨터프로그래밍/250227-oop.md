# What is OOP?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a way of looking at a software system as a collection of interactive objects.

## Objects

Objects represents an entity.

- Physical entity: e.g. Car
- Conceptual entity: e.g. Bank account
- Software entity: e.g. Linked List

## Classes

Class is the blueprint or template of objects.

- Attributes: states, properties, etc.
- Methods: ways to interact with the object

# OOP concepts

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is bundling non-visible attributes/methods with read/write methods to them.  
It's usually implemented using access modifiers(public/private), setters, and getters.

- Abstraction: Hide unnecessary details
- Defensive Programming: Protect data from misuse by the outside world

## Inheritance

Inheritance is making specialization and extension from existing modules/systems.

Is-a relationship indicates inheritance.  
Has-a relationship indicates composition.

- Modularity: Can provide extended/modified functionality without breaking old methods (Can adopt a much more incremental approach!)
- Resuability: Can create new class from existing class
  - Timeliness: Faster development time
  - Reliability: Existing class has testing & validations
  - Consistency: A strict emphasis on regular, coherent design

### Circle-Ellipse Problem

```java
class Ellipse{
  float axisX, axisY;
  Ellipse(float x, float y){axisX = x; axisY = y;}
  public void stretchX(float scaleX){ axisX *= scaleX; }
  public void stretchY(float scaleY){ axisY *= scaleY; }
}
class Circle extends Ellipse{
  Circle(float radius){ super(radius,radius); }
}
```

Circle is an Ellipse, but Circle.stretchX loses its characteristic as a circle!  
OOP is not the best way...

### Interface and Abstract class (in Java)

Interface and abstract class can have abstract method - method without body.

Interface can have multiple inheritance, but can't extend classes.  
Abstract class can extend class and implement inheritance.

Interface provides a common interface between several **unrelated** classes.  
Abstract class provides a blueprint for **closely related** classes.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism provides a way to perform a single action (with the same name) in different ways.

### Overloading

Class can have two or more methods with same name but different signatures!

### Overriding

Subclass can redefine an inherited instance method!

### Hiding (not polymorphism)

Subclass can hide superclass's static method, static variable, instance variable.

Overridden method can't be accessed by casting to superclass, but hidden method/variable can be accessed by casting to superclass.
